Problem statements for assignment 1<br>
<ol>
      <li>
        Create two variables: One that holds a fictional user input (a number of
        your choice) and one that holds no value initially (e.g. "result").
      </li>
      <li>
        Set the result variable to 18 plus the value stored in user input.
      </li>
      <li>
        Add three additional lines of code where you change the result variable
        again (by subtracting a value of your choice, multiplying it and
        dividing it).
      </li>
      <li>
        Think about the value stored in the user input variable you also created
        - did that value change?
      </li>
      <li>
        <code>alert()</code> the result and the user input variables (in two
        separate <code>alert()</code> calls).
      </li>
    </ol>
    
Problem statements for assignment 2 <br>
<ol>
      <li>
        Create two new functions: One that takes no parameters and simply shows
        an <code>alert()</code> with some text of your choice and one that
        receives a name as a parameter and then uses <code>alert()</code> to
        output that name.
      </li>
      <li>
        Call both functions directly from your code.
      </li>
      <li id="task-3">
        Add an event listener to <code>task3Element</code> and attach it to the
        first function (the one without arguments). Click this task thereafter
        to verify whether it works.
      </li>
      <li>
        Add a brand-new function that takes three parameters (three strings,
        give them any names you want) that returns one combined string (where the
        three strings are concatenated).
      </li>
      <li>
        Call that new function directly from your code and
        <code>alert()</code> the result of that function.
      </li>
    </ol>
