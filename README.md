This repository contains the problem statements and my solutions to the udemy course by Maximilian Schwarzmuller for learning Javascript.

Here is a course link, [https://www.udemy.com/share/1029Rk3@5UV9EizvtEjK0EbAWRtI0lNkIW65-p8UnqPhspOYg07V6tThOqdt0iJUrisAak5Fxw==/] . 

Problem statements <br>
<ol>
      <li>
        Create two variables: One that holds a fictional user input (a number of
        your choice) and one that holds no value initially (e.g. "result").
      </li>
      <li>
        Set the result variable to 18 plus the value stored in user input.
      </li>
      <li>
        Add three additional lines of code where you change the result variable
        again (by subtracting a value of your choice, multiplying it and
        dividing it).
      </li>
      <li>
        Think about the value stored in the user input variable you also created
        - did that value change?
      </li>
      <li>
        <code>alert()</code> the result and the user input variables (in two
        separate <code>alert()</code> calls).
      </li>
    </ol>
